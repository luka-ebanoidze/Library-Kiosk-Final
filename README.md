# Library Kiosk

The Library Kiosk Project is an innovative system that redefines the book borrowing experience, prioritizing streamlined processes and user interaction. It facilitates efficient browsing, borrowing, and returning of books, maintaining detailed records of book availability and borrower information. With a focus on user security, the system incorporates robust user authentication, allowing patrons to securely register, log in, and access their borrowing history and account details.

At the core of this project is a custom JSON server managing book details, user profiles, and system configurations, ensuring smooth data handling. The interface is styled using Tailwind CSS, providing an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly design. The technology stack includes TypeScript with React, ensuring a robust and maintainable codebase. Leveraging useForm and React Query, the system efficiently manages forms and optimizes data-fetching for enhanced performance.
